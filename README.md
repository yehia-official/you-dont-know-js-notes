# 📚 You Don't Know JS Yet — My Personal Learning Series

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is my personal journey through the amazing **"You Don’t Know JS Yet"** book series by Kyle Simpson.

I'm not just reading — I'm **breaking it down**, explaining the concepts in my own words, and sharing real-life code examples. Whether you're a beginner, a self-learner like me, or just curious about JavaScript, I hope this helps you along your way.
