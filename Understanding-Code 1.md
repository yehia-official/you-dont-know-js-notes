## 🧠 Understanding Code — "You Don't Know JS Yet"

**My notes + thoughts on the first lesson: What is Code?**
---
When I first started learning programming, I thought **code** was just a bunch of instructions we write to make the computer "do stuff".
Simple, right?

But after reading *You Don’t Know JS Yet*, I realized there’s way more to it.

> Code is not written for computers.
> Code is written **for humans to read**, and **for computers to execute**.

That line changed how I think about writing code.

### 💡 Code = Communication

You’re not just writing commands.
You’re **communicating** your thoughts, logic, and ideas — to:

* Future You
* Teammates
* Other devs who’ll read or maintain your code

So when you write messy or unclear code, you're making it harder for everyone — including yourself!

---

### ✍️ Example:

```js
// Bad code: confusing, not clear
var x = y + z;

```

Okay… but **what’s x?**
**What are y and z?**

---

Now look at this version:

```js
// Good code: clear intention
const totalPrice = itemPrice + shippingCost;
```

Same result, but a HUGE difference in readability.
That’s what writing code for humans looks like.

### 🧩 Code is Like a Language

Languages exist to help us **express** things.
Code does the same — it’s a way to express logic clearly.

That’s why we have **syntax**, **style guides**, and best practices.
Not to make life hard, but to make the code easy to understand.

---

### 🔁 Code is a Skill You Refine

At first, you focus on getting it to work.
Then you focus on writing it better.
Then you learn to write it clearly, in a way others (and your future self) can understand.

That’s the real journey.

---

### 🧘‍♂️ My takeaway from Chapter 1:

> Don't just make the computer understand.
> Make sure **you** understand.
> Make sure **others** can too.

---

### 🚀 If you're just getting into JS…

Start asking yourself:

* “Can I read this code after a week?”
* “Can someone else understand this without asking me?”
* “Would I enjoy reading this code if I were reviewing it?”

That’s when you’re not just coding —
You’re **becoming a real developer.**

Would love to hear from others learning JS — how do YOU keep your code clean and readable?
